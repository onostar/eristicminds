					The Nigeria Labour Congress has called off its strike scheduled for November 6<br>
					The strike was called off after the NLC reached an agreement with the 
					federal government on the new minimum wage<br><br>
					“The Prince of Wales will be looking at the causes, talking to people who 
					are working in this area and together, seeing if we can find solutions 
					and move on.<br><br>
					The federal government suggested N24,000 as the new minimum wage while 
					the organised labour insisted on N30,000.</p>

					<p>However, The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) has suspended its planned 
					strike action following an agreement reached with the federal 
					government.<br><br>
					The Cable reports that Ayuba Wabba who is the president of the NLC spoke 
					after the tripartite committee meeting held on Monday, November 6.<br>
					It was reported that after the long hours of meeting, an agreement 
					was reached followed by signing of documents.<br>
					Wabba said: <em>“Having reached this position and agreements signed, 
					the proposed strike action is hereby suspended.”</em></p>
					<p>Vanguard reports that Ama People who is the chairperson of the committee 
					said the government has suggested N24,000 minimum wage but the NLC 
					insisted on N30,000.<br> She said: <em>“We have concluded and we have a 
					little challenge with what we call Chapter 5 of our report, that is 
					where we have the numbers and the figures we used for the negotiations 
					and the figures that we concluded with and the committee has two figures: 
					the N24,000 suggested by the federal government and the N30,000 given by 
					the organized labour.</em><br><br>
					<em>“There is no stalemate. We have finished and we have signed it but we are 
					insisting that the strike must be called off. There are still two 
					figures, N24,000 and N30,000. You know that labour came up with a figure 
					of N66,500 but when we put all that together with the figure we got from 
					the states…so, we put all that in a basket plus the initial figure that 
					the federal government recommended which was N20,700. We put them 
					together in a basket and came up with four scenarios, we worked with one 
					of the scenarios and that was how we agreed on that N24,000 and N30,000 
					respectively."</em></p>
					<p>The minister for labour, Chris Ngige, on his part said the committee 
					was working to securing an appointment with President Muhammadu Buhari.<br>
					<em>He said: “We are making progress. The governors’ figure should be the 
					figure of the federal government. We are just trying to carry them along. 
					That is why we made the discussions ‘tripartite plus’. It is just because 
					we want to carry them along, otherwise the federal government speaks for 
					governments. Yes, the figures are standing but we know that there are o
					ther processes. It has to go through the Federal Executive Council, the 
					National Executive Council and the National Council of State, then an 
					Executive Bill will be transmitted to the National Assembly.”</em></p>
					<p>Daily Trust however, reports that the government agreed and signed the 
					N30,000 demanded for by the workers.<br> Two union officials and a senior 
					government official confirmed the N30,000 agreement.<br> The chairman of 
					the committee, Amma Pepple, expressed delight that their assignment 
					had been concluded. <br><em>“I am happy to report to you that we have 
					concluded our assignment and we will submit our report to the president 
					by 4.15pm on Tuesday. We will reveal the figure at the presentation,”</em> she said.</p>
