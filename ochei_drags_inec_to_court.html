					<strong>Victor Ochei called for the cancellation of the APC primary election in Delta</strong><br><br>
					Ochei claimed the party and INEC did not use the approved list of 
					delegates <br>He asked that a fresh primary be conducted.<br>Victor Ochei
					who is the former speaker of the Delta state House of Assembly has called on 
					Abuja division of the Federal High Court to nullify the governorship 
					primary election of the All Progressives Congress. The election was held 
					on September 30 and according to Vanguard, the former speaker listed the 
					APC, the Independent National Electoral Commission and Chief Great Ogboru 
					who was declared winner, as defendants.<br>The plaintiff, through his 
					counsel, Ahmed Rahi, called on the court to declare that “the APC 
					governorship primary election that held on September 30, was illegal and 
					unlawful on the ground that delegates not known to law were used for the 
					exercise.” He noted that the high court had in a judgment that was 
					delivered by Justice Anwuri Chikere on June 19, “authenticated a list of 
					delegates of APC in Delta state.” He alleged that the list was side-lined 
					by the party during the primary election</p><br>

					<p>
					Consequently, he urged the court to nullify the purported primary 
					election for being unlawful, unjust and deliberately carried out in 
					disregard of subsisting judicial directive. He also asked the conduct 
					to compel the electoral agency to conduct a fresh election with the 
					approved delegate list.<br><br>
					Recall that violence erupted at the Delta North senatorial district 
					primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday, October 3, 
					leading to the death of two persons. <br>According to Vanguard, there 
					were varying accounts of what transpired; with some sources claiming 
					the victims were killed by police stray bullets at the Federal College 
					of Education, (Technical) where the exercise was being conducted. <br>
					Others, however, said the victims were killed by political thugs. <br>
					<a href="http://Eristicminds.org">Eristicminds.org</a> gathers that the 
					incident was confirmed by the institution’s Student Union speaker, 
					Vincent Ubani, who identified one of the victims as Henry Nweke, a 
					200 level student of Industrial Technical Education. <br><br>
					Ubani, however, could not identify the second corpse; and both bodies 
					have been deposited at the mortuary.</p>
					<p>
					Meanwhile, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan, the immediate past governor of the 
					state, clinched the party’s ticket for the Delta South senatorial 
					district. The former governor expressed happiness with the process and 
					stated that the APC would emerge victorious in the 2019 general
					elections.
